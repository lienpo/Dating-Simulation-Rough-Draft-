Approach,Get out of my office before I find an excuse to expel you!,Have something to say? I suggest you make it quick.,What can I do for you?,I hope your college experience is going well so far.,"Hey, buddy. How’s it goin’?",Oh honey. I’ve been missing you!,My love is here! How are you?,
Ask out,"NOT JUST NO BUT HELL NO, YOU PERVERT!!! YOU KNOW WHAT, YOU’RE NOT COMING TO THIS SCHOOL ANYMORE!!!",You’re joking!,Shouldn’t you be focusing on your studies right now? Both of us have more important things to do.,I understand that you’re a boy and have your needs but there’s plenty of cute girls out there.,Sure. I have time to go do something.,Yes! I get to spend time with my honey!,"Of course, but this time I’d prefer something a little more… in depth. Why don’t you come to my room tonight so we can discuss things.",
Low Academics,From the looks of things you’re not doing so well in school right now. Not that I mind. It means I don’t have to put up with you being around next semester.,So when I looked at the test scores you seemed a little low on the list. Do you need tutoring? Because if you do I’m not helping.,"Son, your grades need improvement. Do I need to help you get a tutor?","Abbot, I want you to come back next semester. That won’t happen if you don’t start studying.","Abbot, we need to talk about your school performance. You’re a good kid and I want you to come back, but you’re grades are terrible. Please improve.","Hey honey! I don’t know what to do with you. You’re grades are horrible and that makes me so sad, because I want to see you next semester. Don’t make me sad. Do better.","Silly boy, if you don’t start doing better in school you’ll never get a job after college. But that’s okay. It just means you’re going to need me to take care of you.",
High Academics,How easy are classes in this college now for a lout like you to do so well?!,"Well, I’ll admit that you’re actually a pretty sharp kid. What do you want?",So I noticed that you made some good grades. Good work!,"My, I’ve seen the grades and aren’t you just the sharp one! Keep up the good work!",You’re really smart! I have to be careful or you just might take over in my research.,Not only is my darling handsome as they come but everyone’s talking about his great grades.,It’s almost kind of scary how good your grades are. I need my dear future husband to be loyal to me.,
Low Fitness,I can’t stand looking at you! Don’t you ever come to my office again until you at least try hitting the gym a little and eating a salad first.,Not looking too good. If you keep living on cheeseburgers and video games like you do it will kill you in the end. Not that I’d mind that.,Are you taking care of yourself? You don’t look so good.,You’ve been gaining weight! You should probably hit the gym a little more.,"Hey. You need to take care of yourself, son. You only have one body and you’re abusing it!","Dearest, you’re not looking so good. How can we grow old together if you get a heart attack?",I have to say. You’re no he-man but you’re just so charismatic.,"Well, you may not be the most physically fit but I still love you."
High Fitness,"You’re keeping in shape at least. I see you dropping out and being a fine, strong cargo-man at a singe processing plant in the future.",You’re as despicable as they come but you keep fit.,"Well look on the muscles on you. You work out, don’t you?",Looking good! I bet the girls are all over you!,My. Aren’t we keeping in shape.,I just can’t stop staring at you any time you come in. You’re just too fit and sexy.,"Well, hello! It’s a big strong hottie alert! ",
Low Social,Get back in your room and stay in there like you always do. You creep me out.,You do realize that no one will hire you can’t work on your social skills? You might as well not finish your degree.,"You should work on your posture a little, son. Grades are important but you need to socialize too.",You always were a little odd.,"You know, Rigel always tells me how worried he is that Leon won’t make it in the world with his people skills but in my honest opinion you’re not much if any better.",You’re such a socially awkward geek but that just means you’re a great scientist.,"Really, though. I love you but you’re such a nerd. I’m going to force you to get out more.",
High Social,"Well you’re one smooth talker, aren’t you. How many girls have you date raped?",You’re a smooth talker but don’t try anything on me. Do that with the naive freshman girls.,"It’s a good thing to see you’re working on your people skills, too. So many scientists don’t because they assume good grades alone are enough in the field.",I’ve heard that you’re a popular one around here. That’s good.,I’m so happy to see you making sure to stay well rounded and keeping your people skills up. If only Leon would take note from you.,You really are a sexy thing. I don’t know too many guys in Persing who can flirt and melt a girl’s heart like you.,"My man is just so good with people, isn’t he? He could be broke and balding and I wouldn’t care.",
Low Confidence,I just love the way you squirm in fear from being around me! Is this how you are around everyone?,Pathetic! I don’t know how you’re going to handle the world if you don’t start manning up.,You’re not going to do well if you don’t stop being so shy.,"Really, you’re so hard on yourself.",This is so sad. Every time I see you I just wonder how you’re ever going to get a girlfriend with how shy you are?,Come on and open up a little! You won my heart over!,Stop cowering away from me like that and give me some love already!,
High Confidence,Well don’t you just think so highly of yourself. Why? You’re pathetic.,"I really never understand how can be so confident, you delusional narcissist. I accomplish more in a day than you do in an entire semester.","You shine self confidence, don’t you?",I have to say. Being around you and seeing you always so happy always rubs on me.,It’s always such a pleasure being around you. Your big smile makes everything better.,That big smile! I just can’t have it leave.,My master is here! His overbearing presence alone is bringing up the room temperature by at least 10 degrees. ,
